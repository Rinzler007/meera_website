Through this, we aim to gain an estimated footfall of about 2000-2500 people, for our pledge campaigns, live interviews, and sessions.    ",

    "Setting up of a Coral Adoption Portal (CAP) for the adoption of corals – like “The Shelter Project” and “Adopt a Tree Campaign” by WWF. The idea is to set up a website through which people can virtually adopt coral reefs, by paying a minimal sum and getting it maintained by us and our collaborators. Establishing coral sanctuaries, made out of scrap metal (Deep-sea Scrap Metal) to serve as both: A Tourist Attraction, and A center for replantation and preservation of Corals. Hence, this approach will help us manifest Project Meera, into an efficient, sustainable, and most importantly impactful project, for Race for Oceans.",

    "We are focusing on the not-so-spoken issue of coral depletion through various awareness campaigns, webinars, and panel discussions. We likewise plan on setting up coral sanctuaries and coral adoption centers in the long term. We aim to achieve this with the help of digital campaigns and awareness drives as our primary step as the major reason of coral depletion is lack of awareness among people regarding the importance of corals. Our second step will be setting up of coral adoption sanctuaries to facilitate the process of adoption of corals for people are willing to go the extra mile.",
