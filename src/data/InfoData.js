    "Witnessing a harsh incident Shikha a high school student was introduced to the concept of discrimination and inequality. She was disappointed to see this and that hit her hard. Since then, she volunteered for every possible fieldwork she could do and help the vulnerable sections of society. She left no stone unturned to explore and understand the problems prevailing in our nation, the root cause of problems and analyze them deeply. She came with various ideas to eliminate the hindrances in the path of development of the nation. Her journey started in 2016 and her five years of experience taught her so much. She has been working under GIRL UP, an initiative of UNITED NATIONS FOUNDATION since 2018 and has been empowering young girls to work for their dreams. In 2020, when the pandemic had hit the country, Shikha wasn’t able to continue with her fieldwork. Then she decided to change the method of providing aid to the needy.",
  paragraphTwo:
    "She along with her friends Shwetank Suman & Yashika Gupta initiated a social youth organization in the month of March named as PEHEL-We For You. We For You denotes- “We three are standing for you and with you.” It was not an easy start, the things were virtual, people were locked in homes but that could not stop us from doing what we wanted to work for the upliftment of society. It is always the action and intention that matters. The three had put their hearts & souls into PEHEL and later became a team of 15 individuals functioning in 2 cities Patna and Delhi with the purpose to serve others. We registered ourselves under Girl Up and became the first and the only functioning Girl Up club in the state of Bihar.  We realized that to initiate is the beginning to bring the change and thus our tag line says “EK PEHEL KARKE TO DEKHO. “",
